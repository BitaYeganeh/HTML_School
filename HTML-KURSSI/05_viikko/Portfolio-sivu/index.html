        <h3>About Me</h3>
        
        <p>
          I'm a web development student at <span class="bold-text">Business College Helsinki</span>, currently immersed in learning the fundamentals of front-end technologies. I have a strong interest in how intuitive, accessible websites are built and how thoughtful design and clean code come together to create great user experiences.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          My current focus is on mastering <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong>, and <strong>JavaScript</strong>. These technologies form the core of my learning as I build responsive layouts, style engaging interfaces, and experiment with interactive features. I'm especially excited by how even the smallest tweak in code can improve usability and performance.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Beyond the technical side, Iâ€™m passionate about <strong>problem-solving</strong> and learning through hands-on projects. I believe the best way to grow is by building real thingsâ€”whether itâ€™s a portfolio website, a small app, or a group assignment. Every new project is an opportunity to explore, make mistakes, and improve.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Collaboration plays a big part in how I learn. I enjoy working in teams, sharing ideas, and gaining feedback from peers and mentors. I value clear communication, curiosity, and staying open to new tools and ways of thinking.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          In the near future, I hope to deepen my knowledge of modern JavaScript frameworks like <strong>React</strong>, and gain experience in version control with <strong>Git</strong> and platforms like <strong>GitHub</strong>. My long-term goal is to become a well-rounded front-end developer who builds websites that are not only functional but also meaningful and inclusive.
