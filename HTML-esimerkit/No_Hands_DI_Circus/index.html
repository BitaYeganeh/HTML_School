        <p>Welcome to my personal homepage! I'm Bita Yeganeh, a digital dream crafter who brings visions to life through the power of code.</p>

        <section id="about">
            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I'm a passionate web development student at <span class="bold-text">Business College Helsinki</span>, where I’m diving deep into the fundamentals of modern front-end development.
              
              <p>
                My current focus is on mastering HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Collaboration is at the heart of how I grow. I enjoy working in teams, bouncing around ideas, and learning from feedback and <strong>learning by doing.</strong>.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                Beyond the technical side, I’m passionate about <strong>problem-solving</strong> and learning through hands-on projects. I believe the best way to grow is by building real things. Every new project is an opportunity to explore, make mistakes, and improve.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                I enjoy working in teams, sharing ideas, and gaining feedback from peers and mentors. I value clear communication, curiosity, and staying open to new tools and ways of thinking.
              </p>
              <p>
                Next, I’m looking forward to diving into <strong>React</strong>, strengthening my skills with Git, and becoming more confident with version control and modern development workflows. My ultimate goal is to become a well-rounded <u>front-end developer</u> who builds websites that are not only technically sound but also meaningful and inclusive.
